a simple math game for kids

math-game is a simple math game for kids to help make memorizing math facts fun.

It gives the user 10 questions that are each randomly chosen to be either
addition or subtraction. The upper limit for the numbers used in the questions is bound at 10 in the beginning. 
For subtraction questions it always subtracts the smaller number from the larger so
that the user doesn't need to understand negative numbers. 

After 10 questions are answered it give a yes or no prompt to play again. 

If they were all answered correctly it pops up a random picture from an images folder. The folder and the images
must be supplied by you and be at the same directory level as the .py files (or the code should be modified
to look somewhere else). Also it will prompt if you want the next round to be harder which if answered yes
will increase the upper limit by 10. Some options for older kids would be change the plus minus options to multiply 
and divide. 

If any questions are missed it will provide a percentage correct and go over the missed questions
showing the question, user's answer and correct answer before prompting to play again. 

Enjoy and have fun learning!
